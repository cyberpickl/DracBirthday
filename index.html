        The truest friend there can be, a real hero (hey! you’ve saved me from getting stranded times infinity), the kindest soul to ever exist and an actual testament to the fact that good people exist. Friendship always wins and it holds your hand through thick and thin, picking you up every time you fall on your face (and chip a tooth — not from experience). Gopal (Aman) Krishna, how honored we are to be able to call you our friend and our brother, and in some cases — our son. We cherish all of our memories and hope to continue holding your hand through every arc you might face — no matter how big the bad guys and how insane their stats. Here’s a collection of stories about how this insane dude with his insane squad managed to fight bad guys and prove that with the power of friendship, you’re always invincible!
