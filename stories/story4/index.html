    <h2>Prologue: Echoes of the Grand Stage</h2>
  <!-- Story Title -->

  <p>The Grand Stage of Hauz Khas Social had once been the jewel of Delhi’s nights, where musicians clashed not with fists or blades, but with chords that could split skies. Legends said the drummers summoned thunder, bards painted constellations with their voices, and choirs held together kingdoms with harmony.

Now it was broken.</p>

  <p>The air smelled of stale smoke and rusted amps. Neon lights flickered like dying fireflies. Rows of empty chairs faced a stage littered with cracked instruments, each one trembling with whispers of souls still chained to their final note. The audience was gone, but their echoes lingered—jeering, clapping, screaming eternally in dissonance.

When Dracxvil entered the abandoned venue, he felt it immediately: the weight of endless performance, of artists locked in battle long after their flesh had turned to dust. Two of his friends—Ella and Lasang—had vanished here days ago, lured by whispers of music begging to be freed.</p>

  <p>The rest of his crew gathered behind him. Claire adjusted her glasses, eyes narrowing as her Mind Web flickered across the shadows of the hall, catching threads of movement before they even emerged. Tay twirled her twin daggers, her stance vibrating with restless energy, speed crackling at her heels like a storm waiting to break.</p>

  <p>“Looks dead,” Tay said, her voice sharp. “But it feels like it’s watching us.”

Claire frowned. “Because it is. The Stage itself isn’t just broken—it’s alive. Patterns are shifting. This entire arena is a prison.”

Drac tightened his grip on his blade. He could already feel the Friendship Surge pulsing in his chest, faint but steady, fueled by the bond he shared with his missing allies.</p>

  <p>“We find Ella and Lasang,” he said, voice firm. “Then we break this prison. Together.”

The Grand Stage hummed in response, as though it had heard the challenge. Somewhere in the dark, phantom strings began to tune themselves, and the opening note of a battle long-forgotten echoed across the hall.

The concert had already begun.</p>


<h2> Chapter 1: The Vanished Duet </h2>

<p>The main floor of Hauz Khas Social was a ruin—tables overturned, bottles shattered, and graffiti scrawled in dozens of languages across the walls. But at its heart stood the stage: cracked wooden boards still glowing faintly beneath broken spotlights.</p>

Ella appeared first, not in flesh but in spectral shimmer. Cats of shadow prowled at her feet, their eyes golden, their tails flickering like metronomes. Her voice carried over the empty seats, soft but resolute.

<p>“You shouldn’t have come here, Drac.”

Drac’s heart twisted. He stepped forward. “Ella—it’s me. We’re here to bring you back.”

The illusion flickered, and the real Ella stumbled from behind the phantom—exhausted, chained at the wrists by glowing notes that burned into her skin. The cats hissed at her bonds but could not break them.

Behind her, Lasang emerged. Her robes of light and shadow were torn, and her hands trembled as she tried to shape her Illumina. Every time she gathered light to her palms, the chains swallowed it, turning her brilliance into nothing but smoke.</p>

<p>“Drac…” Lasang whispered, her voice breaking. “The Stage—once you’re bound, it forces you to play forever. We can’t escape.”

Tay dashed forward instantly, her Lightning Dash cutting a streak of brilliance across the hall as she attempted to slice the chains. But before her blade could connect, phantom musicians rose from the seats. Drummers with skeletal hands pounded broken skins, guitarists with strings of wire-flesh slashed at the air, and a singer with a mouth stitched into a permanent scream loomed in the center.</p>

<p>Claire’s eyes narrowed. Her Mind Web snapped into place, golden threads charting every enemy’s rhythm, predicting beats before they landed. “They’re keeping Ella and Lasang bound by tempo. If we break the music, the chains weaken.”

Drac nodded, his own strength already rising. He could feel Ella’s pain, Lasang’s fading light—but also Claire’s calm, Tay’s fire. His Friendship Surge ignited, wrapping his blade in shimmering hues.

“Then let’s give them a better song,” he growled.</p>

<p>Tay grinned, already a blur of motion, cutting through phantom strings. Claire barked orders, calling out beats before they struck. Drac surged into the fray, every swing powered by the knowledge that his friends believed in him.

Above it all, Ella’s cats yowled in defiance, clawing at the illusions, while Lasang’s dimmed light flickered—just enough to answer Drac’s courage with her own.

The battle for their freedom had begun.</p>
<h2> Chapter 2: The Bassline of Chains </h2>

<p>The further they walked into the belly of Hauz Khas Social, the less it felt like a bar and more like stepping through layers of forgotten concerts. Posters peeled from the walls, half-shredded flyers advertising gigs from decades past floated in the air like dead leaves, and neon signs flickered not in words but in broken fragments of music notes. The air vibrated with a bassline that didn’t belong to any speaker—steady, like a heartbeat, pulling them deeper in.</p>

<p>Claire wrinkled her nose. “Tell me this isn’t the kind of place where some drunk bandmate forgot their solo and cursed the entire stage out of spite.”</p>

<p>Drac snorted. “You’d be surprised how many legends start like that.”</p>

<p>Tay was quieter, fingers brushing the strings of his twin short-blades as if testing their resonance against the rhythm. “It’s not random. The sound—it’s layered. Each beat feels like… chains. Binding something.”

That’s when they saw them.</p>

<p>Ella stood at the edge of the stage, her hair loose, her eyes clouded as if she hadn’t slept in weeks. Around her ankles shimmered faint shackles made of notes, glowing staff lines of music that tightened when she tried to move. Beside her, Lasang sat on an overturned drum, tapping absently on its broken skin. Each tap echoed wrong, as though mocking him. Both looked drained, their movements mechanical, like puppets tied to the song pulsing through the walls.

“Ella!” Drac’s voice cracked the moment he saw her.

Her head jerked up. For a flicker, her eyes softened. “You shouldn’t be here…” Her voice wasn’t fully hers—it was layered, haunted by another singer humming beneath her words. “The Stage… it won’t let you leave.”</p>

<p>Claire stepped forward, her voice sharp as glass. “Well, lucky for us, leaving is Tay’s specialty. And smashing cursed sound systems is mine.”

But before anyone could move, the lights overhead blazed alive. The broken chandeliers stitched themselves together in a cruel shimmer, and the entire room erupted with sound. Not melody. Not harmony. A cacophony—drums beating against each other, guitars wailing without rhythm, voices screaming half-songs that dissolved into feedback. The walls rattled.</p>

<p>From the shadows stepped the reigning band: a quartet of spectral virtuosos. Their forms shimmered like smoke given body—half there, half not. One wielded a shattered violin, strings glowing crimson. Another sat behind a skeletal drum kit that hammered beats too fast for mortal wrists. The lead singer towered above them, his throat a hollow where sound poured out in waves that made even Drac’s knees buckle.

“Contestants,” the singer rasped, voice echoing across the stage. “Another foolish troupe joins the eternal duel. Play—or be bound.”

Ella flinched, her chains tightening. Lasang’s drumsticks glowed in his hands, forcing him to raise them like a marionette.

Drac clenched his fists. “No one forces my friends to play.”

The singer tilted his head, shadows dripping off his jaw. “Then free them—if your music can overpower ours.”</p>

<p>The room shifted. The tables of Hauz Khas melted into stone risers, the bar twisted into a towering amplifier, and the broken stage became an arena of living instruments. Every step they took resonated with echoes of past performances, as if thousands of ghosts were watching.

Claire muttered under her breath, “Great. I always wanted my death to come with a laugh track and an encore.”

Tay smirked faintly. “Don’t worry. If we’re going down, at least we’ll be in rhythm.”</p>

Drac raised his voice, letting it cut through the noise like a blade. “Ella! Lasang! Hold on. We’re going to break this stage.”

And for the first time, the cacophony faltered—just slightly, like a missed note in an otherwise perfect performance. Enough to show that maybe, just maybe, the band wasn’t invincible.

The duel of sound was about to begin.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: The First Duet</h2>

<p> lights dimmed, but the sound only grew louder. A thousand unseen throats hummed the same droning note, like a chorus of ghosts leaning over the balcony of Hauz Khas Social. Dust shook loose from the ceiling, and every neon sign flickered in tempo with the spectral band’s breath.</p>

<p>The lead singer raised his hollow throat and unleashed a roar that became a melody—twisted, dissonant, yet impossible to ignore. His voice cracked the air like glass shattering in slow motion. The violinist followed, each stroke of their crimson strings slicing through the space, notes spilling like blood onto the floor. The skeletal drummer’s sticks blurred into shadows, pounding out a rhythm so fast it turned into chains that wrapped tighter around Ella and Lasang.</p>

<p>Drac’s fists clenched. He didn’t carry an instrument, but his voice—his presence—was an anchor. He slammed his boot on the stage, once, twice, until the reverberation cut against the ghostly rhythm.

“Claire,” he barked, “set the counter-beat!”

Claire grinned, wicked and fierce, like she’d been waiting for this moment her whole life. She grabbed a broken mic stand that had fused with the stage itself, and when she smacked it against the amplifier-bar, sparks erupted. Each hit landed with sharp percussion, crisp and defiant.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said, her smirk wide, “I can play angry noise too.”

Tay joined next, unsheathing his blades. He slashed the air, and the steel sang—literally. Each cut pulled notes from the air, echoes of forgotten melodies trapped in the walls. He wove them into a riff, jagged and precise, a melody that danced with Claire’s chaotic beat.

The ghosts paused for a breath. Just for a heartbeat.

And in that pause, Ella’s eyes cleared. For a flicker, she was herself.</p>

<p>“Drac,” she whispered, her voice carrying despite the storm of sound, “they’re bound to the rhythm. Break it—make your own song, and the chains will weaken!”

Lasang’s drumsticks trembled in his hands, his spirit trying to resist. His voice broke free in fragments: “Counter… them… don’t follow—” before the skeletal drummer forced him back into tempo.

Drac’s chest tightened. He stepped forward, his voice cutting across the duel like a sword. He didn’t sing lyrics, not yet—he roared wordless sound, a defiance that refused to bow. The stage quaked beneath him.

Claire laughed over the racket. “That’s not singing, Drac. That’s just yelling very heroically.”

“Shut up and keep hitting things!” Drac shot back, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

The spectral violin shrieked, furious, striking notes meant to drown him. Tay’s blades intercepted the sound, weaving a counter-melody, sharper, cleaner. The duel was no longer just noise—it was conversation. Clash. Challenge.</p>

<p>Ella screamed, the chains sparking as if straining against their own bonds. Lasang managed one wild strike on the drum, off-rhythm, discordant—and yet it landed like a hammer-blow against the spectral drummer, who faltered for the first time.

Drac seized the moment. He turned to Claire and Tay. “Together!”

Claire slammed her makeshift percussion against the amp. Tay’s blades rang out, slicing notes into the air. Drac’s voice rose, raw and guttural, a battle cry that became harmony in its own brutal way.

For the first time, the spectral band flinched. The audience of ghosts hissed, their chorus stuttering. The chains around Ella cracked. Lasang’s drumsticks glowed brighter.</p>

<p> lead singer staggered, his hollow throat flickering like a broken speaker. His voice turned sharp, desperate. “You… will… not… silence us!”

Drac’s reply thundered back: “We’re not silencing you—we’re rewriting the song!”

And then, for the first time since they’d entered the Broken Stage, the cursed arena listened.

The duel had only begun, but for Ella and Lasang, freedom no longer seemed impossible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4:The Chorus of Chains </h2>

<p>The duel raged like fire on gasoline. Sparks of sound, bright and burning, filled the air. Dracxvil’s voice struck like thunder, Tay’s blades shrieked their song, and Claire hammered her makeshift percussion with battle-born precision. The ghostly band faltered, the stage beneath them trembling as if the floorboards themselves had grown tired of endless repetition.

And then—it happened.

Ella’s chains shattered first, dissolving into a spray of broken notes that rose like startled birds into the rafters. She fell to her knees, gasping, her cats swirling around her in spectral form, their purring drowning out the discordant shrieks of the violin.

Lasang’s followed. The bindings around her wrists splintered like brittle glass, and the ghostly drummer facing her let out a howl of rage as her true power flared. Shadows and light burst from her hands, coalescing into glowing drumsticks of her own making. Her eyes glowed like twin spotlights, sharp and alive again.

Drac stumbled toward them, relief rushing through him. “Ella! Lasang! You’re back—”

Ella flung herself at him with a hug, nearly knocking him flat. “Don’t think you can just come charging in without me. Do you know how boring it was being tied to a cursed karaoke session?!”

Lasang smirked faintly, her tone calm but edged like a chord struck just right. “I wasn’t bored. I was… improvising. Waiting for the right note.” She twirled her luminous drumsticks once, and the shadows around her shrank away. “Now it’s time to end this song.”

The three of them turned to face the enemy together—finally whole again—when the walls of Hauz Khas Social groaned as if alive. The shadows deepened, stretching long across the audience. And then… the others appeared.

The side doors of the bar burst open. Moon stepped in first, pale light spilling from her hands, brushing away the suffocating darkness. Behind her came Shaina, her shield already raised, pushing through a tide of spectral figures that tried to block her path. And, trailing casually behind, whistling a tune, was Illu—tossing a handful of glowing paper airplanes into the air that exploded into bursts of harmless laughter, scattering some of the ghostly crowd.

Drac’s chest loosened. Reinforcements. His family was here.

Shaina slammed her shield into the ground beside him. “Heard you started a concert without us. Rude.”

Moon smiled faintly, healing light washing over Ella and Lasang to restore their strength. “We couldn’t let you have all the fun.”

<p>Illu leaned on his illusory mic stand, grinning ear to ear. “So… when they said Hauz Khas Social is always packed on weekends, I didn’t think they meant this.”

Even in the chaos, Drac laughed, just a little. The weight in his chest lifted.

But the Stage… laughed louder.

It was low at first, a deep rumble in the wood, then rising until every wall, every lightbulb, every glass on every table vibrated with a single mocking tone. The broken speakers lining the walls crackled to life, screaming static that twisted into words:

“You think this is victory? You freed two voices, but what of the hundreds still bound?”

And suddenly, the shadows moved.

From the cracked stage floor, from the peeling posters on the walls, from the graffiti-stained ceiling, they emerged—a thousand silhouettes of bards, drummers, guitarists, singers, pianists. Their faces were blurred echoes, their instruments glowing with spectral light. They filled the club, shoulder to shoulder, balcony to balcony, all staring at the intruders with hollow eyes.</p>

<p>Ella’s breath hitched. “Oh no… it’s not just one band. The Stage itself has become their cage.”

Lasang tightened her grip on her sticks, her voice steady, carrying both dread and resolve. “Every soul that played here… they’re part of the song now.”

The spectral lead singer staggered forward, his hollow throat flickering, and bowed to the gathering mass. “We are not rivals. We are the Chorus of Chains. The eternal audience, the eternal performers. And you…” His empty sockets turned toward Drac, “…will never leave.”

The crowd of ghosts struck their instruments in unison. The sound was unbearable—like being crushed by a wave of noise and memory. The floorboards rippled as though the very wood was alive.
</p>
<p>Shaina raised her shield, straining under the pressure. “I can’t hold this forever. There are too many of them!”

Moon knelt beside her, hands glowing with calm healing light. “Hold on. Just a little longer.”

Drac planted his feet, shoulders square. His friends were here. His strength surged. “Then we’ll free all of you. One note at a time.”

The spectral crowd roared, their instruments raised high. The duel was no longer one band against another. It was one small group of friends against the endless Broken Chorus.

The final performance was only beginning</p>

<h2>Chapter 5:The True Heart of the Abyss</h2>

<p>The Chorus of Chains struck as one. Hundreds of instruments wailed in dissonance, their strings snapping like lashes, their drums booming like war cannons. The walls of Hauz Khas Social shook, beer glasses shattered on abandoned tables, and the floor threatened to buckle beneath the storm of sound.

Dracxvil stood at the center, his blade drawn, glowing faintly with the warmth of every bond he carried. He was outnumbered, yes, but never alone.

“Formation!” Claire shouted, her voice carrying like a commander’s drumbeat. She mapped the chaos instantly, her Mind Web weaving paths where each friend could stand. “Ella—flank with your cats! Tay—cut their rhythm before it builds! Lasang—counter their shadows with your light!”

Ella’s spectral cats swarmed the stage, their claws slicing through cords of black sound, unraveling the tethered notes that held ghost musicians captive. “Go!” she cried, urging them forward. “Find their chains!”

Tay dashed through the mob, a streak of lightning, her twin blades striking faster than the eye could follow. Each slash silenced an enemy instrument mid-note, like snuffing out candles one by one.

Lasang spun her glowing drumsticks, weaving patterns of shadow and light into radiant shockwaves. The blasts rippled through the spectral crowd, scattering their cohesion. Her voice rang out, low and steady: “Music is balance. Let me remind you what harmony feels like.”

Shaina’s shield flared, absorbing the worst of the Chorus’s sonic barrage. She braced against the cacophony, her arms trembling but unyielding. “Stay behind me!” she called, holding back waves of crushing sound.

Moon’s hands glowed silver as she healed exhaustion, mending cracked voices and bruised skin. She touched Drac’s shoulder briefly, and the courage in his chest doubled. “Sing for them, Drac. Sing for all of us.”

Illu leapt into the fray next, conjuring absurd illusions that danced through the shadows: neon cows strumming electric sitars, clowns juggling flaming tablas, cats rapping badly in Hindi. The ghost musicians faltered, their rhythm stumbling, their fury cracking into static.

And above it all, Dracxvil’s voice rose.

Not a perfect song. Not polished, not rehearsed. Raw. Real. Fueled by every memory, every friend, every laugh and heartbreak they’d carried together. His Friendship Surge lit the entire hall like a bonfire, weaving into Claire’s tactics, Ella’s claws, Tay’s speed, Lasang’s radiant mysticism, Shaina’s shield, Moon’s healing, and Illu’s chaotic illusions.

One by one, the ghostly musicians faltered. Chains snapped. Instruments dropped. The chorus began to dissolve into a thousand voices, free and unbound.

But the Stage itself screamed in fury, its broken lights bursting in showers of sparks. “You dare silence me?!” it roared through the crackling speakers. “I am every failure, every rivalry, every song left unfinished—”

Drac raised his blade, glowing brighter with every freed soul. “No. You’re every note that still matters.”

Together, the group struck one last chord. Lasang’s light flared like a sunrise, Ella’s cats roared in harmony, Claire and Shaina steadied the beat, Moon and Illu twined joy and chaos into melody, Tay dashed forward like the strike of a cymbal crash, and Drac carved through the darkness with his final note.

The sound was not just music—it was liberation.

The Stage shattered.

The chorus ended.

And silence, for once, was gentle.</p>

<h2> Epilogue : The Stage Restored</h2>
<p>Morning light spilled through the broken windows of Hauz Khas Social, soft and golden, chasing away the shadows that had long festered there. Where ghostly musicians had once stood, only dust motes now floated, sparkling like stars in the dawn.

Ella stretched, arms wide, cats curling around her ankles. “Finally. My babies hated the acoustics here.”

Lasang smiled faintly, twirling her now-luminous drumsticks before letting them fade. “It feels… lighter. Like the Stage is breathing again.”

Claire ran her hand across a cracked table, her sharp eyes already scanning. “It’s not perfect yet. But it’s free.”

Tay flopped onto a chair, breathing hard, grinning nonetheless. “Best gig ever. I’d pay for those tickets.”

Illu raised his hands as if conducting invisible applause. “And the crowd goes wild! Standing ovation!”

Moon only smiled, serene, her voice quiet but certain. “They can rest now. All of them.”

Drac stood at the center of it all, staring at the fractured stage where it had begun. He felt no weight now—only gratitude. He turned to his friends, his family, every soul who had fought beside him.

“We didn’t just win,” he said softly. “We gave them back their song.”

For a moment, none of them spoke. Then Ella nudged him with a grin. “And next time, Drac? Let’s pick a quieter hangout.”

They laughed together, their voices carrying in a place that had once known only echoes.

The Broken Stage was no longer broken.

It was alive again—reborn in the power of their harmony.</p>
